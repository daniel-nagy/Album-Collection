# Album Collection SPA

#### Web application to organize a user's album collection. :notes:

The server is written in Groovy using the Grails Framework and the client is written in javascript using AngularJS. I'm using http-server from the node package manager to allow the client and server to communicate locally on my machine. The bootstrap theme was generated at http://getbootstrap.com/customize/.
